    "For Spotify songs released between 2022–2026, which audio features (such as danceability, energy, valence, tempo, loudness, acousticness, and speechiness) are most strongly associated with a song’s relative popularity within its genre? Popularity will be measured using Spotify’s track popularity score compared within genres as a percentage, and we will also include control variables such as artist popularity and release year. We will use regression and analysis to find and understand these associations, which allows us to identify which musical features are most predictive of high relative popularity. \n"

    "Our group began our work with the premise that what makes a hit song has become increasingly quantifiable in the era of big data and streaming platforms such as Spotify. Research into what makes a song popular, or at least what increases its likelihood of becoming a hit, has expanded rapidly in recent years. With the proliferation of music datasets and streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music, researchers have sought to determine whether measurable audio features and musical characteristics are associated with commercial success, listener engagement, and critical reception. We focus on Spotify because it provides both a standardized set of audio features (danceability, energy, and valence) and a track-level popularity score on a 0-100 scale, calculated algorithmically and primarily driven by total plays and their recency.\n",
    "\n",
    "One research project by Araujo et al. <sup><a href=\"#ref1\">1</a></sup> used Spotify charts and audio features to model song popularity and predict whether a track would appear in Spotify’s Top 50 Global rankings in the future. They framed the task as a classification problem. They found that machine-learning models achieved strong predictive performance, with AUC (Area Under the Curve) values exceeding 0.80 when forecasting popularity up to two months in advance. Interestingly, they found that adding acoustic features to chart-based predictions yielded only minimal performance gains, suggesting that audio characteristics alone may have limited predictive power. This finding highlights a significant limitation and motivates our focus on identifying which specific Spotify audio features meaningfully contribute to popularity prediction rather than assuming all features are equally informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another related study by Ceulemans and Detry <sup><a href=\"#ref2\">2</a></sup>investigated whether musical characteristics influence commercial success and critics’ rankings preferences using a dataset of 514 songs from 2009 that appeared on multiple year-end charts. The authors constructed variables for tempo, duration, and other musical attributes. They then used regression models to assess their association with success metrics such as Billboard rank, chart longevity, and critics’ lists. Their results suggested that while some features were associated with chart survival and critics’ preferences, other attributes had limited or context-dependent effects on commercial success. This finding is particularly relevant to our project, as it suggests that not all musical features contribute equally to popularity outcomes, and that the feature importance may vary with the success metric used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works like Georgieva et al. <sup><a href=\"#ref3\">3</a></sup>  similarly explore the predictive power of audio features for song popularity. They also framed hit prediction as a classification problem, showing that audio features extracted from songs, such as rhythm and harmony, can help predict whether songs are hits or non-hits in historical chart data. Their work further highlights the difficulty of consistently defining “success” across time periods and datasets, underscoring the importance of carefully selecting and interpreting popularity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these studies suggest that while audio features do contain meaningful information about popularity, their predictive strength is uneven and highly dependent on modeling choices and outcome definitions. Building on this prior work, our project aims to quantify the extent to which Spotify audio features predict popularity and identify which features are the strongest predictors.\n",

    "We hypothesize that songs with higher danceability, energy, and loudness will have higher relative within genre popularity percentages, and that songs with higher instrumentalness and acousticness will tend to have lower relative within genre popularity. We expect these patterns because high energy songs are often promoted in mainstream and playlist-driven listening environments on Spotify, whereas more acoustic/instrumental tracks may appeal to narrower, more niche audiences.
