Popularity will be measured using Spotify’s track popularity score compared within genres as a percentage, and we will also include control variables such as artist popularity and release year. We will use regression and analysis to find and understand these associations, which allows us to identify which musical features are most predictive of high relative popularity. \n"

    "We hypothesize that songs with higher danceability, energy, and loudness will have higher relative within genre popularity percentages, and that songs with higher instrumentalness and acousticness will tend to have lower relative within genre popularity. We expect these patterns because high energy songs are often promoted in mainstream and playlist-driven listening environments on Spotify, whereas more acoustic/instrumental tracks may appeal to narrower, more niche audiences.
